<h2>Anthozoan</h2>

<h3>Physical Attributes</h3>
<p>
Anthozoans are living embodiments of oceanic coral—beautiful, resilient, and deeply 
connected to the rhythms of the sea. Their skin resembles the flexible yet durable 
structure of coral polyps, forming natural patterns and ridges that can range from soft 
pastels to the vibrant warning colors of toxic reef species.
</p>

<p>
Their coloration is not random; the hues that flow across their surface reflect emotional 
states, environmental changes, or even social signals within their communities. The “hair” 
of an Anthozoan is not hair at all, but a mass of sensory tendrils capable of detecting 
currents, temperature shifts, and even faint electrical fields produced by nearby creatures. 
These tendrils move like strands of drifting seaweed and offer Anthozoans unparalleled 
awareness beneath the waves.
</p>

<h3>Culture & Society</h3>
<p>
Anthozoan society is built around the concept of harmony, both environmentally and socially. 
Their communities—called <strong>Groves</strong>—are made up of individuals who grow, shape, 
and maintain coral structures as naturally as other races build cities.
</p>

<p>
Every Anthozoan contributes to the ecosystem they inhabit, mirroring the intricate symbiosis 
of real coral reefs. Art, music, and storytelling reflect oceanic themes, with tales passed 
down through mesmerizing bioluminescent displays and rhythmic, flowing songs that mimic 
the natural movement of underwater life.
</p>

<p>
Their architecture is grown rather than built, shaped from living coral formations that 
blend seamlessly with the surrounding reef. They value cooperation, balance, and 
environmental stewardship, believing that the health of the sea and the health of 
their people are inseparable.

<h2>Human</h2>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
Humans in Mezoria display an astonishing breadth of physical diversity, unmatched by any
other race. Their features vary widely based on lineage, geography, climate, and culture.
Some are <strong>short and stocky</strong>, shaped by labor or harsh environments. Others grow
<strong>tall and lean</strong>, formed by generations of athleticism or nomadic life. Body shape ranges
from <strong>gaunt and underfed</strong> to <strong>robustly muscular</strong> or even <strong>excessively corpulent</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Skin tones span the natural spectrum—from alabaster to deep umber—while hair textures
range from pin-straight to thick coils, in colors from pale flaxen to fiery red to pitch black.
Eye colors are equally varied: browns, greens, blues, hazels, grays, and rare striking anomalies
such as gold or violet.
</p>

<p>
This physical variation is not merely aesthetic; it reflects humanity’s greatest strength:
<strong>adaptability</strong>. Humans thrive in nearly every environment of Mezoria, from frozen tundras
and rolling plains to volcanic islands and dense forests.
</p>

<h3>Religion and Beliefs</h3>
<p>
No race in Mezoria is as deeply entwined with spirituality as humans. They cling fervently
to the worship of the <strong>Aspects</strong>—divine embodiments of fundamental principles such as
Wisdom, War, Mercy, Fate, Shadow, and countless others. Humans believe that the Aspects
shape the course of their lives, guide their destinies, and watch over the balance of the world.
</p>

<p>
Human religious practice is rich and varied. Shrines appear in nearly every settlement; temples
stand as centers of community life. Rituals can be elaborate ceremonies led by priests or simple
daily gestures of gratitude. Pilgrimages, offerings, omens, prayers, and festivals mark the human
calendar, reinforcing their reliance on divine insight in a world filled with uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
Even humans who reject formal worship often carry amulets or mutter prayers “just in case.”
Faith—whether devoted or doubtful—is woven into the core of the human experience.

    <h2>Ethereans: The Otherworldly Entities of Mezoria</h2>

    <p><strong>Origin and Arrival:</strong><br>
    Ethereans are enigmatic beings from beyond the known realms of Mezoria,
    arriving through extraordinary means. Some appear through unstable portals
    or dimensional ruptures, others are summoned by powerful magic, and a rare
    few are restored to life by the divine Aspects. Each Etherean’s origin is
    unique, shaped by the nature of the universe they once inhabited.</p>

    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong><br>
    Ethereans possess forms as varied as the countless realms from which they
    hail. Some resemble creatures of myth, others walk in shapes that defy
    natural order. Their presence often carries subtle distortions of reality—
    glimmers of light, shifting shadows, unusual scents, or ambient energies
    that reveal their otherworldly nature.</p>

    <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><br>
    Their powers seem supernatural to Mezoria’s inhabitants. Ethereans often
    wield abilities that reflect the laws and forces of their home realms:
    temporal manipulation, elemental resonance, psionic force, spatial warping,
    or stranger gifts. No two Ethereans manifest the same talents.</p>

    <p><strong>Integration and Impact:</strong><br>
    The arrival of an Etherean can be a blessing, a curiosity, or a threat.
    Some integrate into society as scholars, explorers, or wanderers, sharing
    knowledge of other worlds. Others bring agendas, mysteries, or dangers from
    realms beyond, challenging Mezoria’s understanding of magic and existence.</p>

    <p><strong>Society and Culture:</strong><br>
    Ethereans have no unified culture within Mezoria. Each carries remnants of
    their past life—if they remember it. Some form small enclaves that reflect
    fragments of their home worlds, while others forge entirely new identities
    among Mezoria’s races.</p>

    <p><strong>Role in Mezoria:</strong><br>
    Ethereans act as bridges to distant realities. Their presence alters
    destinies, expands understanding, and introduces knowledge and power unseen
    in Mezoria. Whether as allies, wanderers, or enigmatic forces, they leave
    lasting marks upon the world.</p>

  description: `
<h2>Mythrian</h2>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
The Mythrians are a powerful fusion of humanoid form and predatory instinct. Their 
physiology reflects their ancestral ties to Mezoria’s apex beasts—wolves, lions, 
eagles, sharks, serpents, and countless others. Each Mythrian bears some combination 
of animalistic traits: fur, feathers, scales, bestial heads, enhanced senses, or 
natural weaponry such as claws and fangs.
</p>

<p>
Their bodies are robust and athletic, standing between <strong>6–8 feet tall</strong>, shaped for 
speed, strength, and survival. Every Mythrian carries the unmistakable aura of a 
creature born to hunt.
</p>

<h3>Sensory & Physical Abilities</h3>
<p>
Mythrians inherit the <strong>heightened senses</strong> and reflexes of the predators whose traits 
they share. Depending on their lineage, they may possess:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>exceptional vision or night sight</li>
  <li>acute hearing and spatial awareness</li>
  <li>a refined sense of smell</li>
  <li>powerful leaps, swipes, or quick bursts of speed</li>
  <li>natural weapons (claws, fangs, talons)</li>
</ul>

<p>
These abilities make Mythrians unmatched as <strong>hunters, scouts, and trackers</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Tribes & Clans</h3>
<p>
Mythrian society is divided into <strong>tribes</strong> each united by a 
common predatory heritage. These groups shape a Mythrian’s traditions, fighting 
styles, and social expectations.
</p>

<p>
The cultural, magical, and ancestral details of each tribe are distinct, but those 
specifics are preserved and taught internally. Outsiders rarely learn more than the 
tribe's name or reputation. A full breakdown of individual clans will be handled 
separately in their own dedicated section.
</p>

<h3>Role in Mezoria</h3>
<p>
Mythrians are respected and feared across Mezoria for their martial strength and 
uncanny instincts. Many serve as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>rangers and trackers</strong> of great renown</li>
  <li><strong>elite warriors</strong> valued for discipline and ferocity</li>
  <li><strong>protectors</strong> of wild regions and sacred natural sites</li>
  <li><strong>skilled mercenaries</strong> whose reputation alone deters conflict</li>
</ul>

<p>
Their relationship with nature makes them natural guardians of the land, and their 
primitive elegance commands respect even among Mezoria’s most powerful races.
</p>

<h3>Cultural Identity</h3>
<p>
Mythrian culture is deeply rooted in <strong>ancestral reverence</strong> and <strong>the sacred hunt</strong>. 
To a Mythrian, hunting is not only sustenance—it is a ritual, a celebration of life 
and balance, and a means of honoring their lineage.
</p>

<p>
Their ceremonies honor the spirits of the predators they embody. Storytelling, dance, 
and tradition revolve around:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>legends of great hunts</li>
  <li>ancestral spirits</li>
  <li>the balance between predator and prey</li>
  <li>the cycles of nature and survival</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mystical Connection</h3>
<p>
Many Mythrians are believed to possess a <strong>subtle spiritual link</strong> to the land, 
their ancestral animal spirits, and the primal forces of Mezoria. This bond may 
manifest as:
</p>

<p>
This mystical heritage makes Mythrians both guardians of their territories and 
keepers of ancient primal wisdom.

 sylvan: {
  label: "Sylvan",
  img: "systems/the-marked-system/assets/races/sylvan.webp",
  description: `
<h2>Sylvan</h2>

<h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
<p>
Sylvans are a striking and elegant people, towering over most at heights that easily
reach or exceed <strong>seven feet</strong>. Their forms are slender and graceful, shaped by
centuries of coexistence with ancient forests. Their skin ranges from pale ivory to
warmly tanned hues, each tone blending naturally with the woodland shadows.
</p>

<p>
Their long, pointed ears and <strong>almond-shaped eyes</strong> are unmistakable markers of their
fey lineage. A Sylvan’s eyes gleam with an inner light—luminous, old, and serene—
reflecting wisdom gathered across centuries.
</p>

<h3>Attire & Demeanor</h3>
<p>
Sylvan clothing is woven from the <strong>living essence of the forest</strong>—leaf-fibers,
enchanted bark-thread, mossweave, and natural dyes that deepen with age. Cloaks of
forest-green, umber, and twilight blue allow them to walk unseen through their
homelands. Their attire is as symbolic as it is functional, expressing their unity
with nature.
</p>

<p>
Their movements are quiet and fluid, their presence serene yet imposing. Even the
most mundane gesture from a Sylvan feels deliberate, measured, and touched by the
poetry of centuries.
</p>

<h3>Lifespan & Culture</h3>
<p>
Sylvans are among the <strong>longest-lived races</strong> in Mezoria, with lifespans extending
beyond a millennium. This immense longevity shapes a culture steeped in tradition,
refinement, and a deep respect for the balance of life.
</p>

<p>
They are <strong>keepers of ancient lore</strong>, guardians of forgotten groves, and historians of
the world’s living memory. Stories, rituals, songs, and magics are passed down through
lineages that trace back to the earliest ages of Mezoria.
</p>

<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>
Sylvan settlements are nestled within <strong>enchanted forests</strong>, hidden among colossal trees,
woven into shimmering canopies, or built into glowing, bioluminescent groves.
Architectural lines imitate the graceful arc of branches or flowing water, forming
homes that feel <em>alive</em> rather than constructed.
</p>

<p>
These sanctuaries are illuminated not by torches but by <strong>natural luminescence</strong>—
glowing vines, crystal-kissed flowers, or magical lights that drift like fireflies.
Visitors often describe Sylvan woods as dreamscapes painted with moonlight.
</p>

<h3>Connection to Nature</h3>
<p>
Of all the mortal peoples, Sylvans possess one of the deepest bonds with the natural
world. Their magic is instinctual, flowing through them as naturally as breath. They
can commune with animals, coax plants to grow, sense disturbances within miles, and
call upon elemental forces when their groves are threatened.
</p>

<p>
To a Sylvan, <strong>nature is both kin and guardian</strong>. Every tree has a voice, every stone a
story, and every breeze a message to be understood.
</p>

<h3>Role in Mezoria</h3>
<p>
As beings of fey blood and ancient purpose, Sylvans act as <strong>mediators between the
natural and magical worlds</strong>. When the balance of Mezoria is endangered—by tyranny,
blight, arcane disruption, or war—it is often the Sylvans who respond first.
</p>

<p>
They are <strong>wise allies</strong> to those who honor the wild… and <strong>unforgiving foes</strong> to those
who trespass against it.

 sprite: {
  label: "Sprite",
  img: "systems/the-marked-system/assets/races/sprite.webp",
  description: `
<h2>Sprite</h2>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
Sprites are <strong>small, radiant woodland beings</strong> whose presence seems to carry the very
essence of enchantment. Standing no taller than a child, their delicate frames are
light and graceful, built for effortless movement through both forest and sky.
</p>

<p>
Their most striking feature is their <strong>multi-colored, mothlike or butterflylike wings</strong>,
each pair glowing softly with hues of pinks, greens, blues, golds, or lilacs. When
Sprites gather, their wings cast prismatic arrays of light across the forest floor,
creating natural spectacles revered by other woodland creatures.
</p>

<p>
Their eyes shimmer like morning dew, and their hair often reflects the tones of wild
flowers or moonlit streams. Everything about a Sprite feels alive, vibrant, and
joyfully unpredictable.
</p>

<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>
Sprites originate from the <strong>Fae Realms</strong>—a place of boundless whimsy, ancient magic,
and unpredictable wonder. They crossed into Mezoria during the earliest age of
interplanar thinning, and unlike many fae, they chose to stay.  
To this day, their spirits carry the strange logic and wild beauty of their homeland.
</p>

<h3>Culture & Nature</h3>
<p>
Sprites are famously <strong>frivolous, curious, and playful</strong>. They treasure games, pranks,
music, dance, and exploration. Their attention is fleeting, their laughter infectious,
and their view of the world eternally optimistic. Yet beneath their whimsical exterior
lies a profound reverence for <strong>nature’s rhythms</strong>.
</p>

<p>
They act as caretakers of glades, flowers, mushrooms, streams, and hidden woodland
groves. Sprites believe every rock, root, and raindrop contains a soul worth respecting.
They form small, communal circles that dance beneath moonlight, draw runes of harmony
into the soil, and sing songs that help the forest grow.
</p>

<h3>Society & Bonds</h3>
<p>
Sprite settlements are hidden within glimmering clearings, mushroom rings, treetop
villages, or small fae thickets where magical energy runs wild. They rarely appoint
leaders; instead, they follow whoever seems the most interesting at the moment.
Tradition, to a Sprite, is whatever hasn’t gotten boring yet.
</p>

<p>
Though gentle in spirit, they are fiercely protective of their homes. A grove blessed
by Sprites is often shielded by charms, illusions, and unpredictable fae tricks.
Those who harm the forest quickly discover the wrath of a thousand tiny wings.
</p>

<h3>Role in Mezoria</h3>
<p>
Sprites serve as <strong>messengers of the wild</strong>, <strong>keepers of fae secrets</strong>, and
<strong>ambassadors of wonder</strong>. Their natural magical talent, boundless curiosity,
and innate connection to life make them invaluable companions—and unpredictable foes.
</p>

<p>
Above all else, Sprites adventure for one reason:  
<strong>to see something new.</strong>

    description: `
<h2>Auramine</h2>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
The Aurumine are a majestic and enigmatic race whose appearance mirrors the very essence 
of the cosmos. Their skin carries a natural metallic sheen, ranging from pale, starlit 
alabaster to deep, rich bronzes and obsidians. Under sunlight, their skin reflects a soft 
celestial glow; under moonlight, they gleam like figures carved from the night sky itself.
</p>

<p>
Their hair flows like liquid metal—golden, silver, coppery, or shimmering blends that ripple 
with reflected light. At night, their hair takes on an ethereal luminescence, faintly 
mirroring constellations or drifting in gleams like falling star-dust.
Their eyes are deep wells of cosmic color, swirling with metallic depth, 
as if containing their own starlight.
</p>

<h3>Culture & Society</h3>
<p>
Aurumine culture is built on the foundations of arcane scholarship and celestial reverence. 
They believe their souls are tied to the cosmic order, and thus they strive to embody harmony, 
discipline, and an unending pursuit of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Their cities and sanctuaries are architectural marvels aligned to celestial bodies—places 
where starlight is captured, reflected, and channeled into ritual magic. Leaders among the 
Aurumine are chosen not by birthright but by wisdom and mastery over cosmic forces. 
Many Aurumine dedicate themselves to artistry, crafting tools and relics inscribed 
with intricate glyphs and symbols that channel astral and arcane energies.
</p>

<p>
To the Aurumine, beauty and purpose are inseparable. Every craft, structure, and ritual 
is both a work of art and a conduit of their connection to the celestial realms.

 draconian: {

  description: `
<h2>Draconian</h2>

<h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
<p>
Draconians are towering, formidable beings—typically standing between 
<strong>7 and 9 feet</strong> tall once they reach adulthood at around 200 years. Their bodies 
are sheathed in scale-plates whose colors and patterns reflect their ancestral lineage. 
These scales shimmer like polished stone, volcanic glass, glacial ice, or living forest bark, 
depending on their clan. Their eyes glow with a primal inner fire, radiant and piercing, 
as if holding the memory of ancient dragons.
</p>

<h3>Lifespan & Growth</h3>
<p>
A Draconian matures slowly compared to other races, reaching full physical and magical 
development only at <strong>200 years</strong>. Their lives may span <strong>up to 600 years</strong>, granting 
them centuries of mastery over the disciplines, traditions, and power systems of their clan. 
This longevity supports a culture deeply rooted in heritage, patience, and accumulated wisdom.
</p>

<h3>Clans & World Lineage</h3>
<p>
Draconians organize their society into powerful 
<strong>World Clans</strong>—lineages defined not by elemental affinity, but by the terrain and 
environments from which their ancient progenitors emerged. These clans embody the raw power 
of Mezoria itself, shaped by stone, storms, tides, forests, and fire.
</p>

<h4>Mountain Clan</h4>
<p>
Stalwart and immovable, the Mountain Clan embodies the unyielding strength of the peaks.  
Their scales resemble granite, obsidian, or slate, granting them natural resilience.  
They value endurance, discipline, and unshakeable resolve.
</p>

<h4>Sea Clan</h4>
<p>
Graceful and adaptive, the Sea Clan draws power from currents, tides, and the deep.  
Their colors evoke coral reefs, ocean depths, or shimmering surf.  
They are intuitive, strategic thinkers, capable of fluid motion and swift adaptation.
</p>

<h4>Forest Clan</h4>
<p>
Connected to the pulse of living nature, the Forest Clan displays organic patterns 
resembling bark, leaves, or moss. They excel in stealth, harmony, and survival, often 
serving as scouts, trackers, and lore-keepers.
</p>

<h4>Desert Clan</h4>
<p>
Hardened by harsh sun and shifting sands, the Desert Clan embodies endurance through adversity.  
Their scales resemble sandstone, sun-bleached bone, or golden dunes.  
They possess unparalleled stamina, cunning, and heat resistance.
</p>

<h4>Volcano Clan</h4>
<p>
Fierce and relentless, the Volcano Clan channels the destructive and creative force of magma.  
Their scales glow with ember-bright cracks or resemble cooled volcanic glass.  
They are passionate warriors, artisans, and wielders of explosive physical might.
</p>

<h3>Lost Clans</h3>
<p>
Ancient Draconian lore whispers of <strong>World Clans long faded</strong>—those shaped by 
forgotten regions: colossal canyons, deep caverns, arctic wastes, storm plateaus, 
or even now-vanished landscapes. These myths speak of powers untapped and bloodlines hidden, 
fueling endless speculation among scholars and wanderers.
</p>

<h3>Role in Mezoria</h3>
<p>
Respected and feared in equal measure, Draconians stand as one of Mezoria’s most influential 
peoples. Though their clans often hold differing philosophies, they share a powerful bond of 
heritage and unity in times of need. Their presence shifts the balance of any conflict, and 
their wisdom shapes the political, martial, and cultural fabric of the world.

 embergiest: {
  label: "Embergeist",
  img: "systems/the-marked-system/assets/races/embergeist.webp",
  description: `
<h2>Embergeist</h2>

<h3>Origins and Ancestry</h3>
<p>
The Embergeist are a race born from the primordial union of <strong>earth and fire</strong>.
Their arrival in Mezoria began thousands of years ago, when an <strong>Astral Gate</strong>
tore open between realms and deposited them across the land. Though their first bodies 
were shaped by elemental power, the Embergeist long ago adapted and evolved into a 
fully self-sustaining people, carrying within them the legacy of the volatile forces 
that forged their ancestors.
</p>

<h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
<p>
An Embergeist's appearance is a living embodiment of molten creation. Their skin resembles 
<strong>stone, obsidian, or cooled lava</strong>, but beneath the surface burns a visible inner flame. 
Many Embergeist have cracks or channels in their skin that glow with 
<strong>fiery light</strong>, shifting from ember-orange to brilliant magma-white depending on emotion or health.  
Their eyes simmer like smoldering coals, casting a warm, almost hypnotic glow in dim spaces.
</p>

<p>
Despite their rough exterior, their movements carry surprising grace, the heat within 
their bodies granting them fluidity and bursts of explosive physical force.
</p>

<h3>Society and Culture</h3>
<p>
The Embergeist build their lives deep beneath Mezoria—in colossal underground cities 
carved into mountain roots, volcanic caverns, and subterranean magma chambers.  
These cities are illuminated by natural lava flows, geothermal crystal formations, 
and the inner radiance of the Embergeist themselves.
</p>

<p>
Their culture venerates <strong>strength, craftsmanship, and endurance</strong>. Forges are sacred 
spaces where stone and flame are shaped in ritual harmony. Embergeist artisans are 
renowned across Mezoria for their unmatched mastery of <strong>metalwork, smithing, 
geoforging</strong>, and the creation of magical equipment infused with elemental fire.
</p>

<p>
Among their people, the ability to work seamlessly with both stone and flame is considered 
a mark of maturity and spiritual clarity. As such, Embergeist societies often blend 
artisanship with philosophy, creating a culture where creation and identity are deeply intertwined.

  earthen: {
  label: "Earthen",
  img: "systems/the-marked-system/assets/races/earthen.webp",
  description: `
<h2>Earthen</h2>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
The Earthen are stout, compact beings forged from the stone and soil of Mezoria’s deepest reaches. 
Their bodies resemble living sculptures: dense, rugged skin with natural cracks and seams where 
glowing mineral light occasionally shines through. Small fragments of rock protrude along their 
arms, shoulders, and back, giving them a rugged, weathered silhouette.
</p>

<p>
What outsiders often mistake for decorative jewelry is actually part of their anatomy—
<strong>clusters of gemstones</strong> that sprout like hair from their skulls, jaws, and brows. These 
gemstone formations come in countless shapes and hues, from dull granite-like growths to brilliant 
crystalline arrays. Both men and women possess these gemstone “manes” and “beards,” 
making gender nearly impossible for outsiders to identify. Among Earthen, slight differences in 
stone texture, gem cut, and mineral sheen are unmistakable markers of identity and heritage.
</p>

<h3>Temperament</h3>
<p>
Earthen are famously <strong>stoic</strong>. Their emotions move as slowly and as deeply as the tectonic 
forces that birthed them. They speak little, listen much, and only act after long contemplation. 
To most other races they appear <strong>grumpy, curt, or indifferent</strong>, yet their cool demeanor hides a 
well of patience, loyalty, and quiet wisdom.
</p>

<p>
Anger is rare for the Earthen—  
but once roused, it is unstoppable, like a mountain deciding to move.
</p>

<h3>Society & Culture</h3>
<p>
Earthen cities lie far beneath Mezoria’s surface in vast caverns lit by glowing fungi, molten 
channels, and crystal forests. Their communities favor:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>carved stone architecture</strong> shaped directly into the cavern walls</li>
  <li><strong>gem-forging halls</strong> where artisans coax beauty from raw crystal</li>
  <li><strong>deep communal chambers</strong> used for meditation and harmonic chanting</li>
</ul>

<p>
Their culture revolves around concepts of endurance, legacy, and the slow but inevitable shaping 
of the world. They revere the <strong>Earth Heart</strong>, a mythic core of Mezoria representing resilience 
and unbroken strength. Rituals often involve harmonic vibrations—deep chants that resonate through 
stone and can be felt more than heard.
</p>

<h3>Gender & Family</h3>
<p>
Earthen do not emphasize gender distinctions. To outsiders they appear nearly identical, but among 
their own kind they see endless nuances in mineral patterns, gem grain, density, and luster. 
Their familial structures are built around <strong>stone-bonds</strong>—communal kin groups formed through shared 
labor, shared stone ancestry, and shared resonance traditions.
</p>

<h3>Role in Mezoria</h3>
<p>
Earthen are valued across the world as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>master craftsmen</strong> of gemstone, metal, and stone</li>
  <li><strong>miners and excavators</strong> who navigate the depths safely</li>
  <li><strong>geomancers</strong> with an intuitive sense of earth magic</li>
  <li><strong>unshakable warriors</strong> whose patience outlasts any foe</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite their gruff exterior, Earthen are reliable allies whose word is as firm as the mountains. 
Their patience can frustrate more impulsive races, but their wisdom and quiet strength have shaped 
the foundations—literally and culturally—of civilizations throughout Mezoria.

  prismatic: {

  description: `
<h2>Prismatic</h2>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>
Prismatics are beings of breathtaking beauty—humanoid in silhouette, yet formed entirely
of <strong>translucent, faceted crystal</strong>. Their bodies refract light into shimmering rainbows
with every movement, casting prismatic patterns across their surroundings. Each facet
glitters with internal luminescence, giving the impression of a living gem infused
with magical radiance.
</p>

<p>
Despite appearing delicate, their bodies are surprisingly resilient. Their crystalline forms
can withstand great force, yet their elegant, angular structure conveys both <strong>fragility
and eternal strength</strong>. Roughly human-sized, they move with a graceful, otherworldly
fluidity, as though guided by inner harmonic vibrations.
</p>

<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>
Prismatics were crafted by a <strong>lost civilization</strong> over 10,000 years ago—an advanced people
whose mastery of magic blurred the line between art, science, and soulcraft.  
Whether intended as guardians, vessels, or successors, none now remember.
</p>

<p>
When their creators vanished, the Prismatics awoke collectively into sentience.  
Legends claim their minds hold <strong>the remnants of their makers’ collective memory</strong>,
yet fragmented beyond repair. Echoes of ancient knowledge remain, but the clarity
of their origin fades a little more with every passing millennium.
</p>

<h3>Society & Integration</h3>
<p>
Despite their ancient and mysterious past, the Prismatics have integrated well into
the modern societies of Mezoria. Their innate connection to magical currents makes
them natural practitioners of arcane arts, rune-sculpting, and crystalline enchantment.
</p>

<p>
Communities across Mezoria value Prismatics not only for their magical insight,
but for their <strong>balanced, contemplative worldview</strong>. Their perspective—shaped by
fragments of lost ages—often provides clarity in political, spiritual, and arcane matters.
</p>

<h3>Role in Mezoria</h3>
<p>
Prismatics serve as <strong>living artifacts</strong> of the ancient world, their glowing forms
bridging forgotten epochs with the present age. Their bodies resonate with magical
frequencies unique to them, making them highly sought after as scholars, diplomats,
mages, and guardians of arcane lore.
</p>

<p>
Ever searching for the truth of their origin, the Prismatics explore the world with
quiet determination, seeking meaning in the fragments of memory they carry.
Their existence safeguards the balance of Mezoria, for within each Prismatic lies
a spark of ancient creation—and the potential for future revelation.
